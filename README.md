# idm-youtube-dl
This package provides a Python script that uses the popular youtube-dl tool to extract information and download links for all URLs listed in a file. The script then uses Internet Download Manager (IDM) to download the videos sequentially, ensuring fast and efficient downloads. 

To use the package, simply place the Python script and a list of video URLs in the video folder of IDM, and run the script. The script will automatically check every 20 seconds to see if the videos have finished downloading, making it easy to keep track of your downloads.

This package is ideal for anyone who regularly downloads videos from YouTube or other video-sharing sites, and wants a fast, efficient, and reliable way to do so. It's also a great tool for anyone living in countries where access to video content is restricted, as the v2ray proxy support allows you to bypass those restrictions and access the content you want.
